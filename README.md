# J124 Final Project: Analyzing the Most Common and Highest Paying College Majors
### By Nicole Lee

The dataset that I used for this project was from the [FiveThirtyEight Github Data Repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data). The FiveThirtyEight dataset that I used can be found in the files of my repository or can be downloaded through this [link](https://github.com/nmljourn124/final_project/blob/master/recent-grads.csv). The original data was sourced from the American Community Survey 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series and can be downloaded [here](http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums.html).

The data for this project was recorded from a survey given to recent college graduates under the age of 28. The dataset contains information about median earnings, employment status, major in college, and much more.


### Steps I Took to Clean My Data
The data had already been cleaned, so the initial steps I took when opening the doc was just to make the sheet easier to read.
1. Secured the header row, then bolded and highlighted the values and cells to differentiate it from the rest of the table.
2. Text wrap the sheet so that everything is visible in each cell.

### Interrogating My Data
After cleaning my data, I put a filter on my entire dataset to find the highest and lowest value of each column. Here is a bulleted list of information that piqued my interest:
* Most common major for women: Psychology (307,087)
* Least common major for women: Military Technologies (0)

* Most common major for men: Business Management and Administration (173,809)
* Least common major for men: School Student Counseling (119)

* Military Technologies was the major with the least total people employed (0)
* Psychology was the major with the most total people employed (307,933)
* Most full-time employed major: Business Management and Administration
* Least full-time employed major: Military Technologies

### Making Sense of What I Found
Looking at the category of "Total People Employed," I realized that my initial finding was not as surprising as I initially believed. Military Technologies has the least total people in a major and Psychology has the most. So taking their total number of graduates into account, the fact that those two came up as the majors with the least and most total people employed is reflective of the data.
